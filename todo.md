##TO DO:

###Refactor:
1. Refactor to client/server side, add database
1. advance logic to include more hikes and quiz questions
1. scrape data/ use trail API



1. Add more logic to account for additional hike options
1. Add database with Mongo
1. Set server side so can host on heroku
1. Get scroll to results working properly
1. Take quiz again button
1. Organize how paragraph data is presented for each hike
1. Make  map more interactive:
  *display location name with some info on tag
  *have user be able to enter their address to see travel time
1. pull all hikes from database and plot on map
  *click on point and go to full hike page info, or can type in directions to see how far
  *have this be main page feature and quiz later on, "not sure where you want to go, take the questionnaire to find out!"
1. make a component where back end user/ system admin can add a camp spot or hike and then have front end user see it plotted on a map and click it for more info

##Questions:
1. Use API (but from where???) or make my own database?
1. How to tie hikes to area?
  -proximity by certain number of miles?
  -tag each hike with a closest major city?
1. How to handle multiple features?
1. How am I am going to make adding new hikes dynamic in logic?
  -do math to compare lat/long and test from major city distance?

*Seperate app to pull in data from api, merge with my data, normalize, add to database

*for logic, true/false, number range, to filter more dynamically?

*distance: calculate distance from starting point to all hikes, if less than a certain distance, will be in <2 hr filter...


##Notes
*data visualization?,
  *of all hikes in co, add to 'cart' and compare
