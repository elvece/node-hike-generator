##TO DO:

###Refactor:
1. Add more logic to account for additional hike options
1. Add database with Mongo
1. Set server side so can host on heroku
1. Get scroll to results working properly
1. Take quiz again button
1. Organize how paragraph data is presented for each hike
1. Make  map more interactive:
  -display location name with some info on tag
  -have user be able to enter their address to see travel time

##Questions:
1. Use API (but from where???) or make my own database?
1. How to tie hikes to area?
  -proximity by certain number of miles?
  -tag each hike with a closest major city?
1. How to handle multiple features?
1. How am I am going to make adding new hikes dynamic in logic?
  -do math to compare lat/long and test from major city distance?

*Seperate app to pull in data from api, merge with my data, normalize, add to database

*for logic, true/false, number range, to filter more dynamically?

*distance: calculate distance from starting point to all hikes, if less than a certain distance, will be in <2 hr filter...
