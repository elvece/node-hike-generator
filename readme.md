## The Trail Hike Generator

### Description
The Trail aims to provide an easy and efficient hike generating service for individuals traveling to Colorado, or individuals simply seeking a straightforward resource for finding their next adventure.

By completing a short questionnaire, users receive a personalized recommendation. Users will be able to also browse all reviewed hikes, check in at the hike location and comment about the trail status while in proximity, and maneuver advanced Google Map functionality to scope and plan their adventure.

###About
This project is a current work in progress. New features have been outlined and will be implemented over the next few weeks as I complete my education experience at Galvanize's Full-Stack Web Development Program.
